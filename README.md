## Tips for Best Results

### Background Removal
- Use images with clear contrast between subject and background
- Ensure good lighting in the original image
- Simple backgrounds work best
- Higher resolution images generally produce better results

### Image Resizing
- Maintain aspect ratio for best visual quality
- Consider the final use case when choosing dimensions
- Use PNG format when transparency is needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Background removal fails**
   - Ensure the image has good contrast
   - Try with a different image
   - Check that the image file is not corrupted

2. **Application won't start**
   - Verify Python 3.7+ is installed
   - Check all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Ensure tkinter is available (usually included with Python)

3. **Images don't display properly**
   - Check file format compatibility
   - Ensure image files are not corrupted
   - Try with different image files

### Performance Notes

- Background removal is CPU-intensive and may take several seconds
- Large images will take longer to process
- The application uses threading to prevent UI freezing during background removal

## Technical Details

- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter
- **Image Processing**: Pillow (PIL)
- **Background Removal**: rembg (AI-powered)
- **Threading**: Background processing to maintain UI responsiveness
